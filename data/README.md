# Data description

## Host range

Virus host range data was collected and digitized from literature. Only viruses whose sequences are available were considered. 

## Sequences

Sequences for viruses were retrieved from the NCBI database. 

For the host, if there were more than 1 sequence available one was chosen randomly as a representative species. For some host, a complete genome was not available. In that case the next best option was used (scaffolds and/or contigs). If no host sequence was available, that virus-host pair was not considered for this analysis.
