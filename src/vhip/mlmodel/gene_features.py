"""Contains classes to compute gene-level features.

This module provides:
- Gene: calculate codon counts, amino acid counts, and imprecise codon counts for a single gene
- GeneSet: calculate codon counts, codon frequency, RSCU (relative synonymous codon usage), amino acid counts, and amino acid frequency for a set of genes in an annotated file
- CodonBiasComparison: compare codon bias measurements between two gene sets using linear regression (slope, R^2) and cosine similarity
